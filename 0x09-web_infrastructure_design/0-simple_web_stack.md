## What is a server?
A server is a computer or a software program that provides a specific kind of service to other computers or programs, known as clients. In the context of web development, a server is typically a computer or a software program that stores and delivers web pages and other resources to clients over the internet.

## What is the role of the domain name?
A domain name is a human-readable address that is used to identify a website on the internet. The role of a domain name is to provide a memorable and easy-to-remember address for a website, so that users can access it without having to remember its IP address.

## What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com?
The "www" in "www.foobar.com" is a subdomain, and it is typically mapped to an A record in the DNS (Domain Name System). An A record maps a domain name to an IP address, allowing clients to connect to the web server that hosts the website.

## What is the role of the web server?
A web server is a computer or a software program that stores and delivers web pages and other resources to clients over the internet. The role of a web server is to receive HTTP requests from clients, process them, and return HTTP responses containing the requested resources.

## What is the role of the application server?
An application server is a software program that provides an environment for running web applications. The role of an application server is to handle the business logic and processing of web requests, providing dynamic content to the web server for delivery to clients.

## What is the role of the database?
A database is a structured collection of data that is used to store and organize information for easy access and retrieval. In the context of web development, a database is typically used to store the data for a web application, such as user profiles, product listings, or order histories.

## What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?
The server is using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website. When the user requests a web page, the server responds with an HTTP response containing the requested content. The browser on the user's computer then renders the content for display.

## Single point of failure (SPOF)
Single point of failure (SPOF): This infrastructure relies on a single web server to handle all incoming requests. If the web server fails or goes offline, the entire website becomes unavailable. To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to set up redundant servers or use load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.

Downtime during maintenance: If maintenance is needed on the web server, such as deploying new code or updating the software, the website will be unavailable while the server is offline. To minimize the impact of downtime, it's recommended to schedule maintenance during off-peak hours and to use techniques such as rolling deployments to minimize the impact on users.

Limited scalability: If the website experiences a sudden surge in traffic, the single web server may not be able to handle the load, leading to slow page load times or even server crashes. To scale the infrastructure, it's recommended to use techniques such as horizontal scaling, which involves adding additional servers to handle incoming traffic, or using a content delivery network (CDN) to cache and distribute content globally.
