# 0x0B. SSH
SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows secure remote access to a computer or server over an unsecured network. It provides a secure channel over an insecure network by encrypting all communication between the client and the server.

SSH uses a client-server model, where the client initiates a connection to the server and authenticates itself to the server using a username and password or a public/private key pair. Once authenticated, the client can execute remote commands on the server or transfer files to and from the server.
